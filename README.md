## Summary of  of research questions
What are the 3 dominant factors that increase the likelihood of having a stroke?
  - We will investigate what factors have the highest occurrence of stroke
Does having more than 1 risk factor impact how likely one is to have a stroke? ( Measure the rate)
  - We will investigate how the percentage of strokes for the combinations of risk factors change
Can we predict if someone is likely to have a stroke given the presence of certain risk factors? 
  - We will investigate if the presence of a risk factor can predict instances of stroke

## Motivation
Nearly 800,000 people in the United States suffer from a stroke each year, with about three in four being first-time strokes. Every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a stroke. Every 3.5 minutes, someone dies of stroke. Strokes are also the leading cause of long-term disability and the leading preventable cause of disability. However, stroke is one of rare conditions that have sudden symptoms and vary by each individual. Therefore, understanding stroke and its risk factors as well as knowing factors that might affect the likelihood of getting a stroke are crucial and necessary. Knowing the signs and symptoms of stroke and seeking medical attention immediately can reduce the risk of disability and death. In addition, understanding the risk factors for stroke can help individuals take steps to prevent stroke from occurring in the first place, including making lifestyle changes such as exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and quitting smoking. For those who have experienced a stroke, understanding the condition is essential for managing the physical, cognitive, and emotional disabilities that can result. Rehabilitation can help individuals regain function and improve their quality of life. Finally, understanding stroke is critical for public health efforts to reduce the burden of stroke on individuals, families, and communities. Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and by working to prevent stroke and improve outcomes for those who have experienced a stroke, we can make a significant impact on public health. Therefore, with these important reasons, they motivated us to do the project about stroke and gain a deeper understanding of stroke and analyze its risk factors and predict the likelihood of having stroke in individuals.
