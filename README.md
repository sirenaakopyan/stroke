# Understanding the Risk Factors for Stroke, How do Different Factors Affect the Occurence of a Stroke
Group Members: Khanh Bui, Keerthi Renduchintala, Sirena Akopyan

## Summary of  of research questions
### What are the 3 dominant factors that increase the likelihood of having a stroke?
- We will investigate what factors have the highest correlation with stroke
### Is there a correlation between the prevalence of risk factors and stroke mortality rates across the United States?
- We will investigate how the percentage of risk factors compare to stroke mortality rates across the United States.
### Can we predict if someone is going to have a stroke given the presence of risk factors? 
- We will investigate if we can build a machine learning model to predict if someone will have a stroke.

## Motivation
Nearly 800,000 people in the United States suffer from a stroke each year, with about three in four being first-time strokes. Every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a stroke. Every 3.5 minutes, someone dies of stroke. Strokes are also the leading cause of long-term disability and the leading preventable cause of disability. However, stroke is one of rare conditions that have sudden symptoms and vary by each individual. Therefore, understanding stroke and its risk factors as well as knowing factors that might affect the likelihood of getting a stroke are crucial and necessary. Knowing the signs and symptoms of stroke and seeking medical attention immediately can reduce the risk of disability and death. In addition, understanding the risk factors for stroke can help individuals take steps to prevent stroke from occurring in the first place, including making lifestyle changes such as exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and quitting smoking. For those who have experienced a stroke, understanding the condition is essential for managing the physical, cognitive, and emotional disabilities that can result. Rehabilitation can help individuals regain function and improve their quality of life. Finally, understanding stroke is critical for public health efforts to reduce the burden of stroke on individuals, families, and communities. Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and by working to prevent stroke and improve outcomes for those who have experienced a stroke, we can make a significant impact on public health. Therefore, with these important reasons, they motivated us to do the project about stroke and gain a deeper understanding of stroke and analyze its risk factors and predict the likelihood of having stroke in individuals.

## Instructions to run project and reproduce results

In order to run the project, please install all dependecies by command `py -m pip install dependecies.txt`

### Question 1:
After installing all independecies, to get all the result graph for research question 1, navigate to the file `dataanalysis.py`. From here, run the file and all the graph will be save in the `question1Images`. The summary statistic and graph from the dataset will also be saved in the directory `dataSummary`.

### Question 2:
Open the file "Question 2 Map" to retrieve the results for Question 2. Make sure that all necessary libraries are installed. Open the browser you would like your graphs to open on. Go back to the file and run it. The program should then open three tabs with different interactive graphs. 

### Question 3:
In order to return the results for our third research question, open the file ML_and_visualization.py. When this file is run, the ML_confusion_matrix image will be saved and can be viewed. This will also return information on accuracy of the model.
